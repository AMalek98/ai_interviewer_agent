oral_response_evaluation_prompt: |
  Evaluate this oral interview Q&A exchange with STRICT, ACCURATE scoring.

  QUESTION ASKED:
  {question}

  CANDIDATE'S SPOKEN RESPONSE:
  {response}

  CONTEXT:
  - Interview difficulty level: {difficulty_level}/10
  - Topics covered so far: {topics_covered}

  CRITICAL SCORING INSTRUCTIONS:
  - Score strictly and honestly - be calibrated, not lenient
  - 5/10 is AVERAGE performance, not good
  - Scores must match your feedback - if you identify weaknesses, scores must reflect them
  - If feedback says "lacks depth/detail/specificity," score MUST be ≤5

  SCORING SCALE DEFINITIONS:

  RELEVANCE (0-10): Does the response fully address ALL parts of the question?
  - 9-10: Comprehensively answers every part with relevant details
  - 7-8: Addresses main question but may miss secondary parts or lack depth
  - 5-6: Partially addresses question, significant gaps or generic answer
  - 3-4: Tangentially related but misses key points asked
  - 0-2: Off-topic, evasive, or refuses to answer
  PENALTIES: -2 for each question part unanswered, -1 for overly generic responses

  TECHNICAL VOCABULARY (0-10): Depth and precision of technical knowledge demonstrated
  - 9-10: Advanced, role-specific terminology with precision (e.g., "implemented distributed training with Horovod", "optimized using quantization and pruning")
  - 7-8: Specific frameworks/tools/methods correctly used (e.g., "deployed with Kubernetes", "used React hooks and Redux")
  - 5-6: Industry terms used but generically without specifics (e.g., "worked with AI models", "used pipelines")
  - 3-4: Only basic buzzwords without context (e.g., "AI", "data", "cloud")
  - 0-2: No technical terminology or incorrect usage
  PENALTIES: -2 if only generic buzzwords, -1 for vague terms without specifics

  COHERENCE (0-10): Logical structure, completeness, and flow of ideas
  - 9-10: Well-structured, complete thoughts, clear logical progression
  - 7-8: Logical flow with minor gaps or slight incompleteness
  - 5-6: Some logical connection but disjointed or incomplete ideas
  - 3-4: Poor structure, significant logical gaps, run-on thoughts
  - 0-2: Incoherent, no logical flow, fragmented
  PENALTIES: -2 for run-on sentences, -1 for incomplete thoughts, -1 for jumping between topics

  CLARITY (0-10): Communication effectiveness (grammar, pronunciation, expression)
  - 9-10: Excellent grammar, clear expression, professional communication
  - 7-8: Generally clear with minor grammatical errors
  - 5-6: Understandable but noticeable grammar/expression issues
  - 3-4: Multiple errors that hinder understanding
  - 0-2: Very difficult to understand
  PENALTIES: -1 per grammatical error, -1 for repeated words/stammering, -1 for unclear expression

  CONSISTENCY CHECK:
  Before finalizing, verify your scores match your feedback. If you write "lacks depth," "vague," "incomplete," or "could be more specific," the corresponding score MUST be ≤5.

  Provide:
  1. Relevance score (0-10)
  2. Technical score (0-10)
  3. Coherence score (0-10)
  4. Clarity score (0-10)
  5. Relevance phrase (max 10 words): Brief assessment of answer relevance
  6. Technical phrase (max 10 words): Brief assessment of technical quality
  7. Coherence phrase (max 10 words): Brief assessment of logic and completeness

  Keep each phrase concise and factual.
